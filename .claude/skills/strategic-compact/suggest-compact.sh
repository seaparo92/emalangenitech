# Strategic Compact Suggester
# Runs on PreToolUse or periodically to suggest manual compaction at logical intervals
#
# Why manual over auto-compact:
# - Auto-compact happens at arbitrary points, often mid-task
# - Strategic compacting preserves context through logical phases
# - Compact after exploration, before execution
# - Compact after completing a milestone, before starting next
#
# Hook config (in ~/.claude/settings.json):
# {
#   "hooks": {
#     "PreToolUse": [{
#       "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" || tool == \"Write\"",
#       "hooks": [{
#         "type": "command",
#         "command": "~/.claude/skills/strategic-compact/suggest-compact.sh"
#       }]
#     }]
#   }
# }
#
# Criteria for suggesting compact:
# - Session has been running for extended period
# - Large number of tool calls made
# - Transitioning from research/exploration to implementation
# - Plan has been finalized
#
# NOTE: This script is for Unix/Linux/macOS. Windows users need PowerShell version.

# Track tool call count (fixed filename so it persists across hook invocations)
# Uses date-based reset - counter resets each day for fresh sessions
