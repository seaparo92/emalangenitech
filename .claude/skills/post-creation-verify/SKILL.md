# Post-Creation Verification Skill

## Purpose
After creating a new feature (entity, service, controller, component, hook, etc.), automatically verify that ALL required registrations, imports, and wiring are in place. Catches the exact class of bug we hit with the missing `IGenericRepository<OfferTemplate>` registration.

## Activation
Run automatically after creating any new feature file(s). This is a pre-build check — run BEFORE the build-check skill.

---

## How It Works

This skill builds a verification checklist dynamically based on the detected stack. It does NOT hardcode what to check — it discovers what registrations are needed by scanning how existing features are wired.

Results cached in `.claude/skills/post-creation-verify/cache.json` after first detection.

---

## Phase 1: Detect Registration Points

Scan the codebase to find where things get registered/wired. This adapts to any stack:

```
.NET:
  1. Find DI registration files:
     Grep for "AddTransient|AddScoped|AddSingleton" → DI files
  2. Find DbContext:
     Grep for "DbSet<" → DbContext file
  3. Find AutoMapper/Extension profiles:
     Grep for "CreateMap|Profile" → Mapper config files
  4. Catalog what each registration file contains:
     - Service DI: maps IService → Service
     - Data DI: maps IGenericRepository<Entity> → GenericRepository<Entity>
     - DbContext: DbSet<Entity> declarations

Node.js/Express:
  1. Find route registration:
     Grep for "app.use|router.use" → Where routes are mounted
  2. Find module imports:
     Grep for "import.*from" in index/barrel files
  3. Find middleware chain:
     Grep for "app.use(" → Middleware registration

NestJS:
  1. Find module files:
     Glob for *.module.ts → Module declarations
  2. Check providers, controllers, imports arrays

Python/Django:
  1. Find INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
  2. Find urlpatterns in urls.py
  3. Find admin.site.register in admin.py

Python/FastAPI:
  1. Find app.include_router calls
  2. Find dependency injection (Depends) registrations

Java/Spring:
  1. Find @ComponentScan, @Bean definitions
  2. Find application.properties/yml for config

React/Frontend:
  1. Find route registration:
     Grep for "createBrowserRouter|Routes|Route" → Route config file
  2. Find barrel exports:
     Check index.ts files for re-exports
  3. Find query key registrations (if centralized)
```

## Phase 2: Generate Cache

Write detected registration points to `.claude/skills/post-creation-verify/cache.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "registrationPoints": {
    "backend": [
      {
        "type": "service-di",
        "file": "relative/path/to/DI/file",
        "pattern": "services.AddTransient<I{Name}Service, {Name}Service>()",
        "grepCheck": "I{Name}Service",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "type": "repository-di",
        "file": "relative/path/to/Data/DI/file",
        "pattern": "services.AddTransient<IGenericRepository<{Entity}>, GenericRepository<{Entity}>>()",
        "grepCheck": "IGenericRepository<{Entity}>",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "type": "dbcontext",
        "file": "relative/path/to/DbContext",
        "pattern": "public virtual DbSet<{Entity}> {Entity} { get; set; }",
        "grepCheck": "DbSet<{Entity}>",
        "required": true
      }
    ],
    "frontend": [
      {
        "type": "route",
        "file": "relative/path/to/Routes.tsx",
        "grepCheck": "path.*{feature-route}",
        "required": false,
        "note": "Only needed if feature has its own page"
      },
      {
        "type": "barrel-export",
        "file": "relative/path/to/hooks/index.ts",
        "grepCheck": "export.*{hookName}",
        "required": false,
        "note": "Only needed if barrel file exists"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Verification Process

After creating new feature files, run these checks:

### Step 1: Determine what was created
```
From the files just created, extract:
  - Entity/Model name (e.g., OfferTemplate)
  - Service name (e.g., OfferTemplateService)
  - Controller/Router name (e.g., OfferTemplatesController)
  - Frontend component names (if any)
```

### Step 2: Check each registration point
```
For each registration point in cache:
  1. Grep the registration file for the expected pattern
  2. Replace {Name}, {Entity} with actual names
  3. If found → PASS
  4. If NOT found → FAIL (missing registration)
```

### Step 3: Report results
```
Format:
  Registration Verification:
  ✓ Service DI: IOfferTemplateService registered
  ✓ DbContext: DbSet<OfferTemplate> registered
  ✗ Repository DI: IGenericRepository<OfferTemplate> NOT registered
    → Fix: Add to [file] at line [N]:
      services.AddTransient<IGenericRepository<OfferTemplate>, GenericRepository<OfferTemplate>>();
```

### Step 4: Auto-fix missing registrations
```
For each FAIL:
  1. Read the registration file
  2. Find the correct insertion point (same region/section as similar registrations)
  3. Add the missing registration
  4. Report what was added
```

## Phase 4: Stack-Specific Checklists

These are auto-generated from cache, not hardcoded. Examples of what gets detected:

### .NET Backend Feature
```
□ Entity created in Entities/{Feature}/
□ DTOs created in ServiceDtos/{Feature}/
□ Extension methods (ToDto, ToEntity) created
□ Interface created in Interfaces/Services/{Feature}/
□ Service created in Services/{Feature}/
□ Controller created in Controllers/
□ Service registered in Services DI file
□ Repository registered in Data DI file  ← THIS IS WHAT WE MISSED
□ DbSet added to DbContext
□ Database change script created (if no-migration rule)
```

### React Frontend Feature
```
□ Types/interfaces created
□ Service functions created
□ Hooks created (useQuery/useMutation)
□ Container component created
□ Presentation component created
□ Route registered (if new page)
□ Barrel export updated (if index.ts exists)
```

### Node.js/Express Backend Feature
```
□ Model/schema created
□ Service created
□ Controller/handler created
□ Routes defined and mounted
□ Validation middleware added (if applicable)
□ Module exported from index
```

## Phase 5: Integration

```
Feature creation workflow:
  1. Create all feature files
  2. post-creation-verify → Check registrations (this skill)
  3. Auto-fix any missing registrations
  4. build-check → Compile/type-check
  5. Report final status
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. Do NOT skip verification for "simple" changes — always verify
2. Do NOT hardcode registration patterns — detect from existing registrations
3. Do NOT only check one DI file — scan ALL registration points
4. Do NOT silently pass when grep returns no result — report it
5. Do NOT add registrations without finding the correct insertion point (region/section)
