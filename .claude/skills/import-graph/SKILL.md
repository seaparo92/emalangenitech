# Import Graph Skill

## Purpose
Lightweight dependency tracking that maps which files import from which other files. When you change a type, interface, or export, instantly know what else might break — without grepping the entire codebase.

## Activation
- **Generate**: On first use or when user says "refresh graph"
- **Query**: When modifying a shared type, interface, service, or export
- **Update**: Incrementally after creating new files

---

## How It Works

A compact import/dependency graph is maintained at:
`.claude/skills/import-graph/graph.json`

This maps: `file → [files that import from it]` (reverse dependency map).
Focus on shared/core files that are imported by many others.

---

## Phase 1: Detect Import Syntax

Auto-detect how imports work based on the project's language:

```
TypeScript/JavaScript:
  import { X } from "./path"
  import X from "./path"
  require("./path")

C#:
  using Namespace.SubNamespace;
  (also: project references in .csproj)

Python:
  from module import X
  import module

Java:
  import package.Class;

Go:
  import "package/path"

Ruby:
  require "path"
  require_relative "path"
```

---

## Phase 2: Build the Graph

### What to track (high-value files only):
```
DO track reverse dependencies for:
  - Type/interface definition files (*.types.ts, *.interfaces.ts, I*Service.cs)
  - Service files (*.service.ts, *Service.cs)
  - Hook files (*.hook.ts)
  - Model/entity files (*.models.ts, Entity.cs)
  - Shared utility files (helpers, constants, enums)
  - Core/shared components

DO NOT track:
  - Node modules / NuGet packages (external)
  - CSS/style imports
  - Asset imports (images, fonts)
  - Test file imports
```

### Scanning process:
```
1. Identify high-value shared files (types, interfaces, services, models)
2. For each shared file, grep the codebase for files that import from it
3. Build reverse map: shared_file → [dependent_files]
4. Record import count for prioritization
```

## Phase 3: Graph Format

Write to `.claude/skills/import-graph/graph.json`:

```json
{
  "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "graph": {
    "src/modules/features/PassportToWork/models/offerLetter.types.ts": {
      "importedBy": [
        "src/modules/features/PassportToWork/hooks/passportToWork.hook.ts",
        "src/modules/features/PassportToWork/services/passportToWork.service.ts",
        "src/modules/features/PassportToWork/containers/OfferTemplatesTabContainer/OfferTemplatesTabContainer.tsx"
      ],
      "importCount": 3
    },
    "src/modules/core/models/enums/url.enums.ts": {
      "importedBy": ["... many files ..."],
      "importCount": 25
    }
  },
  "highImpactFiles": [
    {
      "file": "relative/path",
      "importCount": N,
      "description": "What this file exports"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Phase 4: Usage

### When modifying a type/interface:
```
Before changing OfferLetterTemplate type:
  1. Load graph.json
  2. Look up "offerLetter.types.ts"
  3. See 3 files depend on it
  4. Check each dependent file for breaking changes
  5. Update dependents if needed
```

### When renaming an export:
```
Before renaming useGetOfferTemplates:
  1. Grep graph for files importing from passportToWork.hook.ts
  2. Update all import statements in dependent files
```

### When deleting a file:
```
Before deleting a service file:
  1. Check if anything imports from it
  2. If importCount > 0 → warn before deleting
  3. Update or remove imports in dependent files
```

---

## Phase 5: Incremental Updates

### After creating a new file:
```
1. Parse the new file's imports
2. For each import, add the new file to that import target's "importedBy" list
3. If the new file exports shared types, add it to the graph as a new entry
```

### After deleting a file:
```
1. Remove the file from all "importedBy" lists
2. Remove its own entry from the graph
```

---

## Scope Control

To keep the graph lightweight (~100-200 lines):

```
Only track files with importCount >= 2 (imported by 2+ files)
Exception: Always track type/interface files regardless of count
Exclude: test files, config files, build scripts
Max entries: 100 files
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. Do NOT track every file — only shared/high-value ones
2. Do NOT include external package imports
3. Do NOT rebuild the full graph for a single file change — use incremental updates
4. Do NOT let the graph exceed 200 entries
5. Do NOT skip checking the graph when modifying shared types
